iArrived
========

OS X app (10.7+) that detects iOS devices entering/leaving the local network - optionally showing a growl notification and playing an iTunes track.

I had a lot of fun writing this last christmas holidays, but ultimately it ended up being more of a learning experience than being practically useful â€“ mostly because our office already has another [network-based welcoming system](http://blog.xk72.com/post/13313246225/the-coolest-thing-ever) in place.

To use, all you have to do is check the "Sync with this phone over Wi-Fi" option in iTunes. Then open iArrived from your menu bar and follow the device.
